how to get movies which has shows in show collection which are the release data is less than today date in theater collection in mongodb

const today = new Date();  // Get today's date

db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    // Join Movies collection with Shows collection using the movie_id reference
    $lookup: {
      from: "shows",  // Name of the Shows collection
      localField: "_id",  // Movie's _id field
      foreignField: "movie_id",  // Show's movie_id field
      as: "showings"  // Resulting field with matching shows
    }
  },
  {
    // Filter for movies where the release_date is before today's date
    $match: {
      release_date: { $lt: today },  // Release date is less than today's date
      "showings.0": { $exists: true }  // Ensure there is at least one associated show
    }
  },
  {
    // Optional: You can project to return only necessary fields
    $project: {
      movie_name: 1,
      release_date: 1,
      showings: 1  // You can include or exclude showings data
    }
  }
])



const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Movie = mongoose.model('Movie'); // Assuming Movie is a Mongoose model
const Show = mongoose.model('Show');   // Assuming Show is a Mongoose model

const getMoviesWithShows = async () => {
  const today = new Date(); // Get today's date

  const movies = await Movie.aggregate([
    {
      $lookup: {
        from: 'shows',
        localField: '_id',
        foreignField: 'movie_id',
        as: 'showings'
      }
    },
    {
      $match: {
        release_date: { $lt: today },
        'showings.0': { $exists: true } // Ensure there's at least one show
      }
    },
    {
      $project: {
        movie_name: 1,
        release_date: 1,
        showings: 1
      }
    }
  ]);

  console.log(movies);
};

getMoviesWithShows();
